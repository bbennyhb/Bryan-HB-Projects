# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University! 

# About Me
Hi! I'm Bryan (he/him), a second-year graduate student studying Public Policy and Management. I grew up in Los Angeles, CA, and did my undergrad in the Bay Area studying English with a minor in City and Regional Planning. Most of my experience throughout undergrad was in communications and newsrooms, pivoting to public policy work my senior year and, recently, real estate with a focus on location strategy.

I enjoy going on runs and playing volleyball during my spare time. Reach out if you want to talk about built environments, urban policy, books, or volleyball. 

# What I hope to learn
I'm primarily interested in building out a one-stop shop for some of the stuff I've worked on throughout the past couple of years. After graduation, I'll be moving to NYC to hopefully work in either community development or real estate services. As such, I'm taking the remainder of my time at Heinz to build out skills that might be useful in those fields. Some of those skills include:


- Building habits that would help me create and present visualizations better
- Familiarize myself with platforms such as Github to showcase my academic and personal projects
- Hold myself accountable for working with data-driven projects
