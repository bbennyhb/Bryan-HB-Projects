# The final story

# Changes made since Part II

## Story Changes

Since Part II, I've revamped the original story draft by choosing a new layout that deviates away from darker background tones and toward cooler, inviting ones. Once that decision was made, I created sections that differed from the ones I intended to use pre-analysis. With the focus on concise information given to an audience in a span of one to two minutes, I decided to forefront the majority of my findings as key visualizations rather than blocks of text. A downside to this is that it may have overstimulated the display with visualizations, leaving audience members wondering what the analysis insights were if they had missed my presentation altogether. However, in understanding that this story would be used as a conversation starter rather than an all-encompassing report, I was comfortable with making that decision. 

## Analysis Approach Changes

When I first began exploring the data and coming up with an idea of the story that I hoped to tell with the analysis that was being done, I was set on exploring the entirety of Los Angeles County — the most populated county in the United States (U.S. 2020 Census). The realization that an analysis of the entire county would constitute an immense amount of data, analysis, and time quickly shifted my focus to key "subdivisions" of Los Angeles County. Those subdivision breakdowns can be found in the *Introduction* section of the story. 


## The audience

It only made sense to identify policymakers as the intended audience for this project given that this is a policy school. As I was conducting my interviews, however, particularly in Part II in which my interviews focused on feedback from friends I had grown up with in LA, I found myself shifting the intended audience toward people who knew what it was like growing up in South Gate. The audience that came to mind when this occurred were people who shared similar experiences (e.g. having to drive _out_ of South Gate to find a nice park, meadow, etc. to spend time with some of the guys we don't get to see very often anymore). In a way, this project felt kind of like a smoothie:  _A little bit of this, a little bit of that_. A little bit of policy implications, a little bit of potential small talk influenced by coming-of-age-esque memories, a little bit of a veiled update as to how grad school is going, and a little bit of fun along the way. Yeah, that sounds right to me.

## Final design decisions

### _Funnel, Funnel, Funnel_

Even after focusing on six key divisions of Los Angeles County, the realization I had prior had rippling effects, though this time it set in after the majority of the GIS methods had been implemented and countless data, layers, and maps had been incorporated. As such, I decided to funnel (yet again) further and focus the visualizations on "standout" divisions (I use standout here loosely, recognizing the bias I may have for visualizing some data analysis for Gateway Cities — the division where I grew up — as opposed to South Bay). 

In doing so, I found it much easier to make my story informative and consumable (i.e. the visualizations highlighted findings to the initial question that led me to this study while remaining clutter-free).

# Final thoughts

I'm most proud of the fact that I (technically) didn't _have_ to use GIS (software or methods) given that Tableau was more than capable of creating maps. Nonetheless, I understood that being able to incorporate GIS would've 1) improved my comfortability with the tool and 2) guided me toward analyses and findings that I may not have been headed toward had I only relied on Tableau. What I enjoyed the most about this project was that it held me accountable, a key goal I had set for myself at the start of this class. While I could've relied heavily on Tableau and chosen a relatively simpler topic with cleaner and easier-to-work-with data, I, instead, chose to do something that gave me the flexibility to incorporate personal interests, skills from other courses, and, most importantly, a *tremendous* amount of patience. 

This project demanded me to become comfortable finding and capable of working with a variety of data files. The search for the data alone was more than half the battle. 

In terms of moving forward, I don't particularly see myself working on a project focused on green spaces, though I'm now a bit more confident in being able to carry out a project that began with an "I can probably do that..."
