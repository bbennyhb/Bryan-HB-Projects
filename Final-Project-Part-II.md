# User research 

## Target audience

Given that green spaces are a common resource for the community (i.e. residents of any neighborhood can visit public parks, nature preserves, etc.), the key stakeholders for this project and representative individuals are primarily Neighborhood Residents of Los Angeles, CA. This is in part due to the focus of the project's region, which will be highlighting green spaces (or a lack thereof) in Los Angeles.

To reach these individuals, I'll be leveraging my network (e.g. friends who still live in L.A.) to conduct interviews about the topic and show them a couple drafts of the visualizations.


## Interview script


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Emphasize the lack of green spaces in some areas of Los Angeles.   |         How far do you have to drive to find a park or lookout view for you or your friends to relax?         |
|   Identify the potential link between better parks and the assumed wealth of that community.  |       Would you say the parks in your neighborhood are smaller, bigger, or about the same as the parks in these drive-to places? Would you say there are fewer, more, or about the same number of parks in these drive-to places as compared to your neighborhood? If "bigger" or "more", why do you think that is?           |
|   Understand areas where my visualizations lack clarity.  |     What do you think this map is showing you? Can you identify a correlation or trend in this graph? How do income and number of parks by city relate to each other? I'm going to show you a map that highlights heat severities by urban zones. As someone who has lived in LA since birth, what can you tell me about the neighborhoods that the map might not show?          |

| Questions               | Interview 1  | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| How far do you have to drive to find a park or lookout view for you or your friends to relax? | Griffith Park's about 30 minutes away without traffic. Usually go to Pasadena for a late-night vibe, also about 30-40 minutes.            |     Not big on hiking so not far since the park is nearby.        |    Anywhere worth seeing is a drive here         |
|                  What do you think this map is showing you?        |      How hot it gets in South Gate.                          |    Temperature by cities in LA.         |     Map of LA with some hot zones and dots/houses.        |
|          As someone who has lived in LA since birth, what can you tell me about the neighborhoods that the map might not show?               |        Santa Monica's pretty rich, close to the beach so that makes sense.                        |      Vernon is industrial, lots of factories there.       |       Inglewood is just for shows now, you go to the Arts District for drinks and barcades.      |


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "Dots" in the map were meant to be population. | Need to symbolize population data better so it's not confused with houses |
| I let the interviewee assign any green space themselves.  |  Should start by defining a green space and not letting the audience think it has to be a big national park, can be a local neighborhood park. |
|  The responses I was getting for correlation questions were not helpful.  |  Need better graph. Add trendline to scatterplot, probably need better income data.          |
